\title{Runs knockoff procedure abbreviated}
\usage{
knockoff_filter_from_stats(X, y, fdr = 0.2, plus = TRUE, Xk, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n-by-p design matrix, with \eqn{n > p}.}

\item{y}{response vector of length n.}

\item{fdr}{desired false discovery rate.}

\item{plus}{True for knockoff+ procedure, false for knockoff procedure.}

\item{Xk}{n-by-p knockoff matrix.}

\item{W}{W test statistics.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
 \item{X}{n-by-p design matrix, rescaled so that \eqn{||X_j||^2_2 = 1}, and augmented if \eqn{n < 2p}.}
 \item{y}{vector of observed responses (augmented if \eqn{n < 2p}). }
 \item{Xk}{n-by-p matrix of knockoff variables.}
 \item{W}{vector of test statistics.}
 \item{thresh}{threshold for variable selection.}
 \item{Selected}{list of selected variables.}
}
\description{
Runs knockoff procedure for Fixed-X from Barber & Candes (2015) but takes in X, knockoffs, y,
and statistics, and computes threshold and returns selected variables. This can be used when
using both knockoff and knockoff+ procedures, the output from one procedure can be put into this
function, which will compute the threshold and return selected variables from the other procedure.
}
\details{
This runs the knockoff filter for a given X matrix and y vector. This controls the false discovery
rate at a given level. This takes in the knockoffs and test statistics and returns the threshold
and selected variables. It should be used to reduce computation when running both knockoff and
knockoff+ procedures on the same data.
